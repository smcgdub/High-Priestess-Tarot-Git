                <p class="card-text">Hello, I'm Nicola, from the moment I picked up my first pack of tarot cards 20
                  years ago, I felt a connection to something magical.

                  Most often I give tarot readings on my houseboat in London. The world of the traditional canal boats
                  and the calming influence of the water makes this my favourite place for giving tarot readings.

                  After deciding to read Tarot professionally, I completed a Tarot foundation course with Treadwell's in
                  London, and I began training in Spiritual Psychotherapy and Holistic Healing. This has taught me
                  invaluable skills on how to read Tarot on a deeper level, how to develop intuitively, and ethical
                  practise and use of the cards.

                  I have given tarot card readings to people from all walks of life, including the Sidemen on YouTube,
                  to people at parties, at festivals, via email, at clubs and at cafes. As a reader, I have been
                  described as being warm, open and non-judgmental, with spot-on accuracy. I have read for people who
                  are totally cynical, very spiritual, and completely agnostic. The cards always come through, giving
                  insightful and practical advice.

        <!-- Why get a tarot card reading -->
        <h2 class="lobster-font h4">Why get a tarot card reading?</h2>

        <p>
          Subconsciously we are all moving ourselves along a certain path. Every day, hundreds of times a day, we make
          little decisions that alter or lead us in a direction. But we're not always consciously aware of where we're
          headed, nor do we clearly see the other paths or hidden influences of our decisions. A Tarot reading helps us
          to connect with our subconscious, to illuminate the path we are currently on, show us other possible paths,
          and explore the likely outcomes of our decisions.
        </p>

        <!-- What to expect from your reading -->
        <h2 class="lobster-font h4">What to expect from your reading</h2>

        <p>
          Whether you've had a tarot reading before or not, you may have lots of questions. The important thing to
          remember is that there are no 'good' or 'bad' cards. Each and every tarot card drawn for your personal reading
          will have many different layers of meaning. The intuition of your tarot card reader is required along with
          knowledge of the individual cards in order to weave together the message that is meant for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          A tarot card reading is not 'fortune telling' in the traditional sense because your path is not set - you are
          ultimately the master of your destiny. But the tarot reading will have you to demystify it by revealing
          insight and hidden influences to help you make decisions, and advice for the best outcome based on the path
          you are on.
